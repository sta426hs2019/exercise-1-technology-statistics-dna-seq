### Technology

ChiP-seq. allows to identify the DNA binding sites of proteins by

 + coupling protein to the DNA
 + cut DNA
 + fish for specific proteins using antibodies
 + reverse coupling and high-throughput sequencing


### Application
 
ChiP-seq. is used to determine how the phenotype could be influenced by transcription factors.

### Statistics

In ChIP-Seq experiments, Poisson distribution is a natural choice to model the observed tag counts. However, Ji et al. (2008) illustrated that a negative binomial model provides a better fit to count data from ChIP-Seq experiments than a constant rate Poisson model. Thus a non-homogeneous negative binomial regression model is proposed.
