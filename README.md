## Workflow
##### First step
Sample preparation: randomly fragment genomic DNA and ligate adapters.
##### Second Step
Cluster generation: bind single strand fragments to the surface of the flow cell. Generate clusters of fragments by bridge amplification.
##### Third Step
Sequencing by synthesis to obtain the reads. Output is an image.
##### Fourth Step
<<<<<<< HEAD
Data analysis to map the reads.
