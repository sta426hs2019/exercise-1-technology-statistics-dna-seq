# ChiP-Seq. 

### Method
ChiP-seq. allows to identify the DNA binding sites of proteins by

 + coupling protein to the DNA
 + cut DNA
 + fish for specific proteins using antibodies
 + reverse coupling by high-throughput sequencing


### Application
 
ChiP-seq. is used to determine how the phenotype could be influenced by transcription factors.
